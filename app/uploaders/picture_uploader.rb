  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:

  #   # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))

  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #

  #   # do something

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  
  # 画像サイズ設定
  # 詳細表示用：400 * 400の正方形に整形
  version :thumb400 do
    process resize_and_pad(400, 400, background = :transparent, gravity = 'Center')

  version :thumb200 do

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_whitelist
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end
   

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
